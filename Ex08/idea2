Fast MVP / No-code workflow (best for quick launch, small stores, prototypes)
- Define the single core goal (what one action must users complete?).
- Pick a no-code or managed platform — Shopify (commerce), Wix/Squarespace (small business), WordPress.com (content + plugins).
- Select template & structure — homepage, product/category pages, contact, policies.
- Configure products / content / payment — add items, variants, taxes, shipping, connect payment gateway.
- Basic SEO & testing — meta tags, mobile check, checkout test.
- Launch quickly & measure — collect user data, then iterate (add features based on real feedback).
