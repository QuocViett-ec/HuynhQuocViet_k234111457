Traditional full-stack workflow (best for custom sites / serious e-commerce)
- Define goals & requirements — audience, business needs, must-have features (catalog, cart, payment, shipping).
- Research & plan — sitemap, user flows, tech choices (CMS vs custom, languages, DB).
- Design (UX/UI) — wireframes → high-fi mockups → design system.
- Choose stack & hosting — e.g., LAMP/LEMP, Node.js, or modern JAMstack; pick VPS / cloud / managed host based on scale and security needs.
- Frontend development — implement responsive HTML/CSS/JS, accessibility, performance optimizations.
- Backend development — APIs, authentication, database schema, business logic.
- Integrations — payment gateway, shipping, analytics, CDN, email. (For e-commerce ensure PCI / HTTPS and secure payment flows.)
- Testing & QA — unit + integration tests, cross-browser, load testing, security scans.
- Deploy & monitor — CI/CD, uptime monitoring, logging, backups.
- Maintain & iterate — bug fixes, feature releases, security updates.
